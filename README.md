Using MATLAB, designed a simulation of a square lattice undergoing percolation.

A lattice gradually has its cells occupied one-by-one at random. An implementation of the breadth-first search (BFS) path-finding algorithm was used to identify the percolating cluster (the first cluster of occupied cells to span opposing ends of the lattice). The percolating cluster was found to be identified on average when 60 percent of cells were occupied. At about 80 percent occupancy, the fraction of occupied cells part of the percolating cluster was nearly 100 percent. Non-linear fitting was used to perform an analysis of the probability of a given cell being occupied versus the fraction of the occupied cells that are part of the percolating cluster.

An example of what this model can be used to simulate is a sol-gel phase transition, where a polymer in a solution crystalizes to form a gel one it spans its environment (hence, the polymer has become a percolating cluster and will quickly merge with the other major clusters, forming the gel).
